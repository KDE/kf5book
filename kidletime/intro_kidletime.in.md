# Detect System Idling

KIdleTime is a helper framework to get reporting information on idle time of the system. It is useful not only for finding out about the current idle time of the system, but also for getting
notified upon idle time events, such as custom timeouts, or user activity. It features:

* current idling time
* timeout notifications, to be emitted if the system idled for a specified time
* activity notifications, if the user resumes acting after an idling periode
