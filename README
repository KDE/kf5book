## Adding a New Chapter
For adding a new chapter for a framework called "myframework", you have to:
1. create a new folder named "myframework"
2. add a new file called "intro_myframework.in.md" to this folder (and optionally further such files later on) 
3. add submodule
   * git submodule add kde:myframework myframework/myframework
4. and commit your changes
